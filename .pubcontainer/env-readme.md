# Environment Read Me

## PRPO Environment

This is an environment intent on experimentation and thought expression, propositions, the logical kind.

We need to be able to quickly evaluate an idea and start expressing that to others for various reasons. We want to begin tracking relationships to the things we think about, to the things that matter to us, personally.

In order to evaluate this flow we have an environment in which to evaluate the need, discuss the behaviors with colleagues, and project a model. This model can be shared and modified at will, we begin with a WebAssembly Client and an API to our backend knowledge in src.

We want to be able to create a particular envvironment and see that it is indeed set the way we desire it to be in our [tests](../tests)
