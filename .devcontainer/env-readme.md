# Environment Read Me

## Headspace Environment
This is an environment intent on experimentation.
We need to be able to quickly evaluate an idea and start expressing that in terms of Domains, Concepts and Events

In order to evaluate this flow we have an environment in which to evaluate the need, discuss the behaviors with colleagues, and project a model. This model can be shared and modified at will.

We want to be able to recreate a particular envvironment and see that it is indeed set the way we desire it to be in our first Unit Test
